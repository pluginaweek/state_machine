module StateMachine
  # Represents a type of module in which class-level methods are proxied to
  # another class, injecting a custom <tt>:if</tt> condition along with method.
  # 
  # This is used for being able to automatically include conditionals which
  # check the current state in class-level methods that have configuration
  # options.
  # 
  # == Examples
  # 
  #   class Vehicle
  #     class << self
  #       attr_accessor :validations
  #       
  #       def validate(options, &block)
  #         validations << options
  #       end
  #     end
  #     
  #     self.validations = []
  #     attr_accessor :state, :simulate
  #     
  #     def moving?
  #       self.class.validations.all? {|validation| validation[:if].call(self)}
  #     end
  #   end
  # 
  # In the above class, a simple set of validation behaviors have been defined.
  # Each validation consists of a configuration like so:
  # 
  #   Vehicle.validate :unless => :simulate
  #   Vehicle.validate :if => lambda {|vehicle| ...}
  # 
  # In order to scope conditions, a condition proxy can be created to the
  # Vehicle class.  For example,
  # 
  #   proxy = StateMachine::ConditionProxy.new(Vehicle, lambda {|vehicle| vehicle.state == 'first_gear'})
  #   proxy.validate(:unless => :simulate)
  #   
  #   vehicle = Vehicle.new     # => #<Vehicle:0xb7ce491c @simulate=nil, @state=nil>
  #   vehicle.moving?           # => false
  #   
  #   vehicle.state = 'first_gear'
  #   vehicle.moving?           # => true
  #   
  #   vehicle.simulate = true
  #   vehicle.moving?           # => false
