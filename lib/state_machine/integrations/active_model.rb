module StateMachine
  module Integrations #:nodoc:
    # Adds support for integrating state machines with ActiveModel classes.
    # 
    # == Examples
    # 
    # If using ActiveModel directly within your class, then any one of the
    # following features need to be included in order for the integration to be
    # detected:
    # * ActiveModel::Observing
    # * ActiveModel::Validations
    # 
    # Below is an example of a simple state machine defined within an
    # ActiveModel class:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include ActiveModel::Observing
    #     include ActiveModel::Validations
    #     
    #     attr_accessor :state
    #     define_attribute_methods [:state]
    #     
    #     state_machine :initial => :parked do
    #       event :ignite do
    #         transition :parked => :idling
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # The examples in the sections below will use the above class as a
    # reference.
    # 
    # == Actions
    # 
    # By default, no action will be invoked when a state is transitioned.  This
    # means that if you want to save changes when transitioning, you must
    # define the action yourself like so:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include ActiveModel::Validations
    #     attr_accessor :state
    #     
    #     state_machine :action => :save do
    #       ...
    #     end
    #     
    #     def save
    #       # Save changes
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # == Validations
    # 
    # As mentioned in StateMachine::Machine#state, you can define behaviors,
    # like validations, that only execute for certain states. One *important*
    # caveat here is that, due to a constraint in ActiveModel's validation
    # framework, custom validators will not work as expected when defined to run
    # in multiple states.  For example:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include ActiveModel::Validations
    #     
    #     state_machine do
    #       ...
    #       state :first_gear, :second_gear do
    #         validate :speed_is_legal
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # In this case, the <tt>:speed_is_legal</tt> validation will only get run
    # for the <tt>:second_gear</tt> state.  To avoid this, you can define your
    # custom validation like so:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include ActiveModel::Validations
    #     
    #     state_machine do
    #       ...
    #       state :first_gear, :second_gear do
    #         validate {|vehicle| vehicle.speed_is_legal}
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # == Validation errors
    # 
    # In order to hook in validation support for your model, the
    # ActiveModel::Validations feature must be included.  If this is included
    # and an event fails to successfully fire because there are no matching
    # transitions for the object, a validation error is added to the object's
    # state attribute to help in determining why it failed.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.new
    #   vehicle.ignite                # => false
    #   vehicle.errors.full_messages  # => ["State cannot transition via \"ignite\""]
    # 
    # In addition, if you're using the <tt>ignite!</tt> version of the event,
    # then the failure reason (such as the current validation errors) will be
    # included in the exception that gets raised when the event fails.  For
    # example, assuming there's a validation on a field called +name+ on the class:
    # 
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.new
    #   vehicle.ignite!       # => StateMachine::InvalidTransition: Cannot transition state via :ignite from :parked (Reason(s): Name cannot be blank)
    # 
    # === Security implications
    # 
    # Beware that public event attributes mean that events can be fired
    # whenever mass-assignment is being used.  If you want to prevent malicious
    # users from tampering with events through URLs / forms, the attribute
    # should be protected like so:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include ActiveModel::MassAssignmentSecurity
    #     attr_accessor :state
    #     
    #     attr_protected :state_event
    #     # attr_accessible ... # Alternative technique
    #     
    #     state_machine do
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # If you want to only have *some* events be able to fire via mass-assignment,
    # you can build two state machines (one public and one protected) like so:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include ActiveModel::MassAssignmentSecurity
    #     attr_accessor :state
    #     
    #     attr_protected :state_event # Prevent access to events in the first machine
    #     
    #     state_machine do
    #       # Define private events here
    #     end
    #     
    #     # Public machine targets the same state as the private machine
    #     state_machine :public_state, :attribute => :state do
    #       # Define public events here
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # == Callbacks
    # 
    # All before/after transition callbacks defined for ActiveModel models
    # behave in the same way that other ActiveSupport callbacks behave.  The
    # object involved in the transition is passed in as an argument.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include ActiveModel::Validations
    #     attr_accessor :state
    #     
    #     state_machine :initial => :parked do
    #       before_transition any => :idling do |vehicle|
    #         vehicle.put_on_seatbelt
    #       end
    #       
    #       before_transition do |vehicle, transition|
    #         # log message
    #       end
    #       
    #       event :ignite do
    #         transition :parked => :idling
    #       end
    #     end
    #     
    #     def put_on_seatbelt
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # Note, also, that the transition can be accessed by simply defining
    # additional arguments in the callback block.
    # 
    # == Observers
    # 
    # In order to hook in observer support for your application, the
    # ActiveModel::Observing feature must be included.  Because of the way
    # ActiveModel observers are designed, there is less flexibility around the
    # specific transitions that can be hooked in.  However, a large number of
    # hooks *are* supported.  For example, if a transition for a object's
    # +state+ attribute changes the state from +parked+ to +idling+ via the
    # +ignite+ event, the following observer methods are supported:
    # * before/after/after_failure_to-_ignite_from_parked_to_idling
    # * before/after/after_failure_to-_ignite_from_parked
    # * before/after/after_failure_to-_ignite_to_idling
    # * before/after/after_failure_to-_ignite
    # * before/after/after_failure_to-_transition_state_from_parked_to_idling
    # * before/after/after_failure_to-_transition_state_from_parked
    # * before/after/after_failure_to-_transition_state_to_idling
    # * before/after/after_failure_to-_transition_state
    # * before/after/after_failure_to-_transition
    # 
    # The following class shows an example of some of these hooks:
    # 
    #   class VehicleObserver < ActiveModel::Observer
    #     # Callback for :ignite event *before* the transition is performed
    #     def before_ignite(vehicle, transition)
    #       # log message
    #     end
    #     
    #     # Callback for :ignite event *after* the transition has been performed
    #     def after_ignite(vehicle, transition)
    #       # put on seatbelt
    #     end
    #     
    #     # Generic transition callback *before* the transition is performed
    #     def after_transition(vehicle, transition)
    #       Audit.log(vehicle, transition)
    #     end
    #     
    #     def after_failure_to_transition(vehicle, transition)
    #       Audit.error(vehicle, transition)
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # More flexible transition callbacks can be defined directly within the
    # model as described in StateMachine::Machine#before_transition
    # and StateMachine::Machine#after_transition.
    # 
    # To define a single observer for multiple state machines:
    # 
    #   class StateMachineObserver < ActiveModel::Observer
    #     observe Vehicle, Switch, Project
    #     
    #     def after_transition(object, transition)
    #       Audit.log(object, transition)
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # == Internationalization
    # 
    # Any error message that is generated from performing invalid transitions
    # can be localized.  The following default translations are used:
    # 
    #   en:
    #     activemodel:
    #       errors:
    #         messages:
    #           invalid: "is invalid"
    #           # %{value} = attribute value, %{state} = Human state name
    #           invalid_event: "cannot transition when %{state}"
    #           # %{value} = attribute value, %{event} = Human event name, %{state} = Human current state name
    #           invalid_transition: "cannot transition via %{event}"
    # 
    # You can override these for a specific model like so:
    # 
    #   en:
    #     activemodel:
    #       errors:
    #         models:
    #           user:
    #             invalid: "is not valid"
    # 
    # In addition to the above, you can also provide translations for the
    # various states / events in each state machine.  Using the Vehicle example,
    # state translations will be looked for using the following keys, where
    # +model_name+ = "vehicle", +machine_name+ = "state" and +state_name+ = "parked":
    # * <tt>activemodel.state_machines.#{model_name}.#{machine_name}.states.#{state_name}</tt>
    # * <tt>activemodel.state_machines.#{model_name}.states.#{state_name}</tt>
    # * <tt>activemodel.state_machines.#{machine_name}.states.#{state_name}</tt>
    # * <tt>activemodel.state_machines.states.#{state_name}</tt>
    # 
    # Event translations will be looked for using the following keys, where
    # +model_name+ = "vehicle", +machine_name+ = "state" and +event_name+ = "ignite":
    # * <tt>activemodel.state_machines.#{model_name}.#{machine_name}.events.#{event_name}</tt>
    # * <tt>activemodel.state_machines.#{model_name}.events.#{event_name}</tt>
    # * <tt>activemodel.state_machines.#{machine_name}.events.#{event_name}</tt>
    # * <tt>activemodel.state_machines.events.#{event_name}</tt>
    # 
    # An example translation configuration might look like so:
    # 
    #   es:
    #     activemodel:
    #       state_machines:
    #         states:
    #           parked: 'estacionado'
    #         events:
    #           park: 'estacionarse'
    # 
    # == Dirty Attribute Tracking
    # 
    # When using the ActiveModel::Dirty extension, your model will keep track of
    # any changes that are made to attributes.  Depending on your ORM, an object
    # will only be saved when there are attributes that have changed on the
    # object.  When integrating with state_machine, typically the +state+ field
    # will be marked as dirty after a transition occurs.  In some situations,
    # however, this isn't the case.
    # 
    # If you define loopback transitions in your state machine, the value for
    # the machine's attribute (e.g. state) will not change.  Unless you explicitly
    # indicate so, this means that your object won't persist anything on a
    # loopback.  For example:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include ActiveModel::Validations
    #     include ActiveModel::Dirty
    #     attr_accessor :state
    #     
    #     state_machine :initial => :parked do
    #       event :park do
    #         transition :parked => :parked, ...
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # If, instead, you'd like your object to always persist regardless of
    # whether the value actually changed, you can do so by using the
    # <tt>#{attribute}_will_change!</tt> helpers or defining a +before_transition+
    # callback that actually changes an attribute on the model.  For example:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     ...
    #     state_machine :initial => :parked do
    #       before_transition all => same do |vehicle|
    #         vehicle.state_will_change!
    #         
    #         # Alternative solution, updating timestamp
    #         # vehicle.updated_at = Time.curent
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # == Creating new integrations
    # 
    # If you want to integrate state_machine with an ORM that implements parts
    # or all of the ActiveModel API, only the machine defaults need to be
    # specified.  Otherwise, the implementation is similar to any other
    # integration.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   module StateMachine::Integrations::MyORM
    #     include StateMachine::Integrations::ActiveModel
    #     
    #     @defaults = {:action = > :persist}
    #     
    #     def self.matches?(klass)
    #       defined?(::MyORM::Base) && klass <= ::MyORM::Base
    #     end
    #     
    #     protected
    #       def runs_validations_on_action?
    #         action == :persist
    #       end
    #   end
    # 
    # If you wish to implement other features, such as attribute initialization
    # with protected attributes, named scopes, or database transactions, you
    # must add these independent of the ActiveModel integration.  See the
    # ActiveRecord implementation for examples of these customizations.
