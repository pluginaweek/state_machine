module StateMachine
  module Integrations #:nodoc:
    # Adds support for integrating state machines with MongoMapper models.
    # 
    # == Examples
    # 
    # Below is an example of a simple state machine defined within a
    # MongoMapper model:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include MongoMapper::Document
    #     
    #     state_machine :initial => :parked do
    #       event :ignite do
    #         transition :parked => :idling
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # The examples in the sections below will use the above class as a
    # reference.
    # 
    # == Actions
    # 
    # By default, the action that will be invoked when a state is transitioned
    # is the +save+ action.  This will cause the record to save the changes
    # made to the state machine's attribute.  *Note* that if any other changes
    # were made to the record prior to transition, then those changes will
    # be saved as well.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.create          # => #<Vehicle id: 1, name: nil, state: "parked">
    #   vehicle.name = 'Ford Explorer'
    #   vehicle.ignite                    # => true
    #   vehicle.reload                    # => #<Vehicle id: 1, name: "Ford Explorer", state: "idling">
    # 
    # == Events
    # 
    # As described in StateMachine::InstanceMethods#state_machine, event
    # attributes are created for every machine that allow transitions to be
    # performed automatically when the object's action (in this case, :save)
    # is called.
    # 
    # In MongoMapper, these automated events are run in the following order:
    # * before validation - Run before callbacks and persist new states, then validate
    # * before save - If validation was skipped, run before callbacks and persist new states, then save
    # * after save - Run after callbacks
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.create          # => #<Vehicle id: 1, name: nil, state: "parked">
    #   vehicle.state_event               # => nil
    #   vehicle.state_event = 'invalid'
    #   vehicle.valid?                    # => false
    #   vehicle.errors.full_messages      # => ["State event is invalid"]
    #   
    #   vehicle.state_event = 'ignite'
    #   vehicle.valid?                    # => true
    #   vehicle.save                      # => true
    #   vehicle.state                     # => "idling"
    #   vehicle.state_event               # => nil
    # 
    # Note that this can also be done on a mass-assignment basis:
    # 
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.create(:state_event => 'ignite')  # => #<Vehicle id: 1, name: nil, state: "idling">
    #   vehicle.state                                       # => "idling"
    # 
    # This technique is always used for transitioning states when the +save+
    # action (which is the default) is configured for the machine.
    # 
    # === Security implications
    # 
    # Beware that public event attributes mean that events can be fired
    # whenever mass-assignment is being used.  If you want to prevent malicious
    # users from tampering with events through URLs / forms, the attribute
    # should be protected like so:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include MongoMapper::Document
    #     
    #     attr_protected :state_event
    #     # attr_accessible ... # Alternative technique
    #     
    #     state_machine do
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # If you want to only have *some* events be able to fire via mass-assignment,
    # you can build two state machines (one public and one protected) like so:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include MongoMapper::Document
    #     
    #     attr_protected :state_event # Prevent access to events in the first machine
    #     
    #     state_machine do
    #       # Define private events here
    #     end
    #     
    #     # Public machine targets the same state as the private machine
    #     state_machine :public_state, :attribute => :state do
    #       # Define public events here
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # == Validations
    # 
    # As mentioned in StateMachine::Machine#state, you can define behaviors,
    # like validations, that only execute for certain states. One *important*
    # caveat here is that, due to a constraint in MongoMapper's validation
    # framework, custom validators will not work as expected when defined to run
    # in multiple states.  For example:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include MongoMapper::Document
    #     
    #     state_machine do
    #       ...
    #       state :first_gear, :second_gear do
    #         validate :speed_is_legal
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # In this case, the <tt>:speed_is_legal</tt> validation will only get run
    # for the <tt>:second_gear</tt> state.  To avoid this, you can define your
    # custom validation like so:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include MongoMapper::Document
    #     
    #     state_machine do
    #       ...
    #       state :first_gear, :second_gear do
    #         validate {|vehicle| vehicle.speed_is_legal}
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # == Validation errors
    # 
    # If an event fails to successfully fire because there are no matching
    # transitions for the current record, a validation error is added to the
    # record's state attribute to help in determining why it failed and for
    # reporting via the UI.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.create(:state => 'idling')  # => #<Vehicle id: 1, name: nil, state: "idling">
    #   vehicle.ignite                                # => false
    #   vehicle.errors.full_messages                  # => ["State cannot transition via \"ignite\""]
    # 
    # If an event fails to fire because of a validation error on the record and
    # *not* because a matching transition was not available, no error messages
    # will be added to the state attribute.
    # 
    # In addition, if you're using the <tt>ignite!</tt> version of the event,
    # then the failure reason (such as the current validation errors) will be
    # included in the exception that gets raised when the event fails.  For
    # example, assuming there's a validation on a field called +name+ on the class:
    # 
    #   vehicle = Vehicle.new
    #   vehicle.ignite!       # => StateMachine::InvalidTransition: Cannot transition state via :ignite from :parked (Reason(s): Name cannot be blank)
    # 
    # == Scopes
    # 
    # To assist in filtering models with specific states, a series of basic
    # scopes are defined on the model for finding records with or without a
    # particular set of states.
    # 
    # These scopes are essentially the functional equivalent of the following
    # definitions:
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include MongoMapper::Document
    #     
    #     def self.with_states(*states)
    #       all(:conditions => {:state => {'$in' => states}})
    #     end
    #     # with_states also aliased to with_state
    #     
    #     def self.without_states(*states)
    #       all(:conditions => {:state => {'$nin' => states}})
    #     end
    #     # without_states also aliased to without_state
    #   end
    # 
    # *Note*, however, that the states are converted to their stored values
    # before being passed into the query.
    # 
    # Because of the way named scopes work in MongoMapper, they *cannot* be
    # chained.
    # 
    # Note that states can also be referenced by the string version of their
    # name:
    # 
    #   Vehicle.with_state('parked')
    # 
    # == Callbacks
    # 
    # All before/after transition callbacks defined for MongoMapper models
    # behave in the same way that other MongoMapper callbacks behave.  The
    # object involved in the transition is passed in as an argument.
    # 
    # For example,
    # 
    #   class Vehicle
    #     include MongoMapper::Document
    #     
    #     state_machine :initial => :parked do
    #       before_transition any => :idling do |vehicle|
    #         vehicle.put_on_seatbelt
    #       end
    #       
    #       before_transition do |vehicle, transition|
    #         # log message
    #       end
    #       
    #       event :ignite do
    #         transition :parked => :idling
    #       end
    #     end
    #     
    #     def put_on_seatbelt
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    # 
    # Note, also, that the transition can be accessed by simply defining
    # additional arguments in the callback block.
    # 
    # === Callback Order
    # 
    # Callbacks occur in the following order.  Callbacks specific to state_machine
    # are bolded.  The remaining callbacks are part of MongoMapper.
    # 
    # * (-) save
    # * (1) *before_transition*
    # * (-) valid
    # * (2) before_validation
    # * (3) after_validation
    # * (4) before_save
    # * (5) before_create
    # * (6) after_create
    # * (7) after_save
    # * (8) *after_transition*
    # 
    # == Internationalization
    # 
    # Any error message that is generated from performing invalid transitions
    # can be localized.  The following default translations are used:
    # 
    #   en:
    #     mongo_mapper:
    #       errors:
    #         messages:
    #           # %{value} = attribute value, %{state} = Human state name
    #           invalid_event: "cannot transition when %{state}"
    #           # %{value} = attribute value, %{event} = Human event name, %{state} = Human current state name
    #           invalid_transition: "cannot transition via %{event}"
    # 
    # You can override these for a specific model like so:
    # 
    #   en:
    #     mongo_mapper:
    #       errors:
    #         models:
    #           user:
    #             invalid_event: "is not valid"
    # 
    # In addition to the above, you can also provide translations for the
    # various states / events in each state machine.  Using the Vehicle example,
    # state translations will be looked for using the following keys, where
    # +model_name+ = "vehicle", +machine_name+ = "state" and +state_name+ = "parked":
    # * <tt>mongo_mapper.state_machines.#{model_name}.#{machine_name}.states.#{state_name}</tt>
    # * <tt>mongo_mapper.state_machines.#{model_name}.states.#{state_name}</tt>
    # * <tt>mongo_mapper.state_machines.#{machine_name}.states.#{state_name}</tt>
    # * <tt>mongo_mapper.state_machines.states.#{state_name}</tt>
    # 
    # Event translations will be looked for using the following keys, where
    # +model_name+ = "vehicle", +machine_name+ = "state" and +event_name+ = "ignite":
    # * <tt>mongo_mapper.state_machines.#{model_name}.#{machine_name}.events.#{event_name}</tt>
    # * <tt>mongo_mapper.state_machines.#{model_name}.events.#{event_name}</tt>
    # * <tt>mongo_mapper.state_machines.#{machine_name}.events.#{event_name}</tt>
    # * <tt>mongo_mapper.state_machines.events.#{event_name}</tt>
    # 
    # An example translation configuration might look like so:
    # 
    #   es:
    #     mongo_mapper:
    #       state_machines:
    #         states:
    #           parked: 'estacionado'
    #         events:
    #           park: 'estacionarse'
